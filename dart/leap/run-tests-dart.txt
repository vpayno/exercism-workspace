dart pub global activate coverage
Package coverage is currently active at version 1.6.3.
Resolving dependencies...
The package coverage is already activated at newest available version.
To recompile executables, first run `dart pub global deactivate coverage`.
Installed executables collect_coverage, format_coverage and test_with_coverage.
Warning: Pub installs executables into $HOME/.pub-cache/bin, which is not on your path.
You can fix that by adding this to your shell's config file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.):

  export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"

Activated coverage 1.6.3.
