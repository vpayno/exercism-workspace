package protein // import "protein"

Package protein is used to translate RNA sequences into proteins.

VARIABLES

var ErrInvalidBase = errors.New("Invalid Base")
    ErrInvalidBase is used to signal FronCodon that an invalid codon has been
    encountered.

var ErrStop = errors.New("STOP")
    ErrStop is used to signal FromCodon to stop processing codons.


FUNCTIONS

func FromCodon(codon string) (string, error)
    FromCodon returns a single protein from a codon.

func FromRNA(rna string) ([]string, error)
    FromRNA returns a protein sequence from an RNA sequence.
