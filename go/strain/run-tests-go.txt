Package strain implements collection keep and discard functions.

TYPES

type Ints []int
    Ints integer collection.

func (i Ints) Discard(filter func(int) bool) Ints
    Discard returns a new collection containing those elements where the
    predicate is false.

func (i Ints) Keep(filter func(int) bool) Ints
    Keep returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate
    is true.

type Lists [][]int
    Lists slice integer collection.

func (l Lists) Keep(filter func([]int) bool) Lists
    Keep returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate
    is true.

type Strings []string
    Strings string collection.

func (s Strings) Keep(filter func(string) bool) Strings
