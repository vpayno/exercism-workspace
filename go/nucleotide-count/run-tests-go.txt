package dna // import "dna"

Package dna is a package used to inspect DNA sequences.

TYPES

type DNA string
    DNA is a list of nucleotides.

func (d DNA) Counts() (Histogram, error)
    Counts generates a histogram of valid nucleotides in the given DNA. Returns
    an error if d contains an invalid nucleotide. / Counts is a method on the
    DNA type. A method is a function with a special receiver argument. The
    receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the
    method name. Here, the Counts method has a receiver of type DNA named d.

func (d DNA) IsValid() (bool, error)
    IsValid returns true if the DNA strand is valid.

func (d DNA) String() string
    String returns a pretty formated representation of a DNA type.

type Histogram map[rune]int
    Histogram is a mapping from nucleotide to its count in given DNA. Choose a
    suitable data type.
