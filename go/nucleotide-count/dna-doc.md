# dna

```go
import "dna"
```

Package dna is a package used to inspect DNA sequences\.

## Index

- [type DNA](<#type-dna>)
  - [func (d DNA) Counts() (Histogram, error)](<#func-dna-counts>)
- [type Histogram](<#type-histogram>)


## type [DNA](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/nucleotide-count/nucleotide_count.go#L18>)

DNA is a list of nucleotides\.

```go
type DNA string
```

### func \(DNA\) [Counts](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/nucleotide-count/nucleotide_count.go#L29>)

```go
func (d DNA) Counts() (Histogram, error)
```

Counts generates a histogram of valid nucleotides in the given DNA\. Returns an error if d contains an invalid nucleotide\. / Counts is a method on the DNA type\. A method is a function with a special receiver argument\. The receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the method name\. Here\, the Counts method has a receiver of type DNA named d\.

## type [Histogram](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/nucleotide-count/nucleotide_count.go#L15>)

Histogram is a mapping from nucleotide to its count in given DNA\. Choose a suitable data type\.

```go
type Histogram map[rune]int
```
