```go
import "resistorcolor"
```

Package resistorcolor single helps users identify resistors using their color bands.

## Variables

ColorNames maps Color type to it's string representation.

```go
var ColorNames = map[Color]string{
    Undefined: "undefined",
    Black:     "black",
    Brown:     "brown",
    Red:       "red",
    Orange:    "orange",
    Yellow:    "yellow",
    Green:     "green",
    Blue:      "blue",
    Violet:    "violet",
    Grey:      "grey",
    White:     "white",
}
```

## func [ColorCode](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/resistor-color/resistor_color.go#L97>)

```go
func ColorCode(color string) int
```

ColorCode returns the resistance value of the given color. I guess instead of having a map\[String\]int\{\} to do the lookups, we have to search a \[\]String\{\} array and find the element with that string and return the index. They really sucked the fun out of this function.

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>

```go
{
	var color Color

	for color = Undefined; color <= ColorMax; color++ {
		name := color.String()
		value := ColorCode(name)

		fmt.Printf("Resistor band color %s has a value of %d\n", name, value)
	}

}
```

#### Output

```
Resistor band color undefined has a value of -1
Resistor band color black has a value of 0
Resistor band color brown has a value of 1
Resistor band color red has a value of 2
Resistor band color orange has a value of 3
Resistor band color yellow has a value of 4
Resistor band color green has a value of 5
Resistor band color blue has a value of 6
Resistor band color violet has a value of 7
Resistor band color grey has a value of 8
Resistor band color white has a value of 9
```

## func [Colors](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/resistor-color/resistor_color.go#L78>)

```go
func Colors() []string
```

Colors should return the list of all colors. They are limiting your implementation possibilities. Not sure why even bother having a function since the contents of it are very static. I don't wan't to use an array to store the color data, I'm going to use an Enum instead. Now to find a clever way of generating the data from an Enum type that isn't a type and it's just a bunch of constants.

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>

```go
{
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", Colors())

}
```

#### Output

```
[black brown red orange yellow green blue violet grey white]
```

## type [Color](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/resistor-color/resistor_color.go#L5>)

Color type represents the value of a resistor's band.

```go
type Color int
```

Color constants used as an Enum. Starts with \-1 for which is used as an undefined color.

```go
const (
    Undefined Color = iota - 1
    Black
    Brown
    Red
    Orange
    Yellow
    Green
    Blue
    Violet
    Grey
    White
)
```

To make Color lower and upper bound tests clearer, let's define constants. Black and White are at the lower and upper boundaries. All other colors should be between them.

```go
const (
    ColorMin Color = Black
    ColorMax       = White
)
```

### func \(Color\) [Int](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/resistor-color/resistor_color.go#L64>)

```go
func (c Color) Int() int
```

Int returns the integer representation of a Color. Yes, we could just use int\(Color\); But, this is more fun.

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>

```go
{
	var color Color

	for color = Undefined; color <= ColorMax; color++ {

		name := strings.Title(color.String())

		value := color.Int()

		fmt.Printf("%s is %d\n", name, value)
	}

}
```

#### Output

```
Undefined is -1
Black is 0
Brown is 1
Red is 2
Orange is 3
Yellow is 4
Green is 5
Blue is 6
Violet is 7
Grey is 8
White is 9
```

</p>
</details>

### func \(Color\) [String](<https://github.com/vpayno/exercism-workspace/blob/main/go/resistor-color/resistor_color.go#L54>)

```go
func (c Color) String() string
```

String implements the Stringer interface. Another way of getting the String equivalent of a Color. We're going to use both to help make this exercise interesting. You can also use a switch in here; But, since we have our min/max constants, this should be easier to maintain. This also allows us to provide a response for undefined colors without complicated error checking since this exercise lacks error returns on the functions being tested.

<details><summary>Example</summary>
<p>

```go
{
	var color Color

	for color = Undefined; color <= ColorMax; color++ {

		name := strings.Title(color.String())

		value := color.String()

		fmt.Printf("%s is %s\n", name, value)
	}

}
```

#### Output

```
Undefined is undefined
Black is black
Brown is brown
Red is red
Orange is orange
Yellow is yellow
Green is green
Blue is blue
Violet is violet
Grey is grey
White is white
```
