package sieve // import "sieve"

Package sieve of Eratosthenes is used to find all the primes from 2 up to a
given number.

FUNCTIONS

func Sieve(limit int) []int
    Sieve returns a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes Litering the code with
    optimization todos so I can play with Go benchmarks.

        algorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes is
        	input: an integer n > 1.
        	output: all prime numbers from 2 through n.

        	let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n,
        	initially all set to true.

        	for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding âˆšn do
        		if A[i] is true
        			for j = i2, i2+i, i2+2i, i2+3i, ..., not exceeding n do
        				set A[j] := false

        	return all i such that A[i] is true.
