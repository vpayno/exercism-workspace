FUNCTIONS

func Atbash(plain string) string
    Atbash returns a simple substitution cipher text. Ciphertext is written
    out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size being 5 letters,
    leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded. This is to make it
    harder to guess things based on word boundaries. All text will be encoded as
    lowercase letters.
