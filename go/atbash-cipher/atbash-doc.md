```go
func Atbash(plain string) string
```

Atbash returns a simple substitution cipher text\. Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length\, the traditional group size being 5 letters\, leaving numbers unchanged\, and punctuation is excluded\. This is to make it harder to guess things based on word boundaries\. All text will be encoded as lowercase letters\.

	cipher := Atbash(plain)

	fmt.Printf(" plain: %q\ncipher: %q\n", plain, cipher)

}
```

#### Output

plain: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
cipher: "zyxwv utsrq ponml kjihg fedcb a"
