func ByDaysPeriod(p DaysPeriod) func(Record) bool
    ByDaysPeriod returns predicate function that returns true when the day of
    the record is inside the period of day and false otherwise

func CategoryExpenses(in []Record, p DaysPeriod, c string) (float64, error)
    CategoryExpenses returns total amount of expenses for records in category c
    that are also inside the period p. An error must be returned only if there
