1..16
ok 1 no multiples within limit
ok 2 one factor has multiples within limit
ok 3 more than one multiple within limit
ok 4 more than one factor with multiples within limit
ok 5 each multiple is only counted once
ok 6 a much larger limit
ok 7 three factors
ok 8 factors not relatively prime
ok 9 some pairs of factors relatively prime and some not
ok 10 one factor is a multiple of another
ok 11 much larger factors
ok 12 all numbers are multiples of 1
ok 13 no factors means an empty sum
ok 14 the only multiple of 0 is 0
ok 15 the factor 0 does not affect the sum of multiples of other factors
ok 16 solutions using include-exclude must extend to cardinality greater than 3
