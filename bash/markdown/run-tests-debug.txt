<h1>Markdown</h1><p></p><p>Welcome to Markdown on Exercism's Bash Track.</p><p>If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.</p><p></p><h2>Instructions</h2><p></p><p>Refactor a Markdown parser.</p><p></p><p>The markdown exercise is a refactoring exercise. There is code that parses a</p><p>given string with [Markdown</p><p>syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and returns the</p><p>associated HTML for that string. Even though this code is confusingly written</p><p>and hard to follow, somehow it works and all the tests are passing! Your</p><p>challenge is to re-write this code to make it easier to read and maintain</p><p>while still making sure that all the tests keep passing.</p><p></p><p>It would be helpful if you made notes of what you did in your refactoring in</p><p>comments so reviewers can see that, but it isn't strictly necessary. The most</p><p>important thing is to make the code better!</p><p></p><h2>Source</h2><p></p><h3>Created by</h3><p></p><p>- @glennj</p><p></p><h3>Contributed to by</h3><p></p><p>- @guygastineau</p>
